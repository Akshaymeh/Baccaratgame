Baccarat Game (JavaFX)
This is a simple Baccarat game implemented in Java using JavaFX for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows the player to play a round of Baccarat against a banker on a 5x5 grid layout, with the option to start a new round at any time. The game logic is based on the traditional rules of Baccarat, and the user interacts with the game through a graphical interface.

To run the Baccarat game, you will need:

Java: Ensure you have Java 8 or later installed on your machine.
JavaFX: JavaFX must be properly set up in your IDE for GUI components to function.
Gameplay Instructions
When the game starts, the window will display a "Start New Round" button.
Click the button to start a new round. Cards will be dealt to both the player and the banker.
The result of the round (who won or if it was a tie) will be displayed in the window.
You can start another round by clicking the "Start New Round" button again.
Game Rules
Baccarat is a card game where both the player and banker are dealt two cards each.
Card values are assigned as follows:
Ace is worth 1 point.
2-9 are worth their face value.
10, Jack, Queen, and King are worth 0 points.
The hand value is calculated by adding up the card values and taking the last digit of the total (i.e., a total of 15 would be worth 5).
The player or banker with the highest hand value wins the round.
